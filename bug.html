<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug that can occur when using inline styles with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.  The problem arises when you accidentally include a typo or an invalid CSS property within your inline style definition.  Browsers may handle these errors differently, sometimes ignoring the entire style block or only applying part of it. This often leads to unexpected visual results or layout issues that are difficult to debug because the error isn't immediately obvious in the source code.</p> <p> For example: </p> <pre><code>&lt;style&gt; .myClass { color:blue;   backgroun-color:red; /*Typo in background-color*/ } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;div class="myClass"> This text should have blue color and red background &lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
